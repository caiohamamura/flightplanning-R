\title{Function to calculate flight parameters}
\usage{
flight.parameters(
  height = NA,
  gsd = NA,
  focal.length35 = 20,
  image.width.px = 4000,
  image.height.px = 3000,
  side.overlap = 0.8,
  front.overlap = 0.8,
  flight.speed.kmh = 54,
  max.gsd = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{height}{target flight height, default NA}

\item{gsd}{target ground resolution in centimeters, must provide either `gsd` or `height`}

\item{focal.length35}{numeric. Camera focal length 35mm equivalent, default 20}

\item{image.width.px}{numeric. Image width in pixels, default 4000}

\item{image.height.px}{numeric. Image height in pixels, default 3000}

\item{side.overlap}{desired width overlap between photos, default 0.8}

\item{front.overlap}{desired height overlap between photos, default 0.8}

\item{flight.speed.kmh}{flight speed in km/h, default 54.}

\item{max.gsd}{maximum ground resolution}
}
\description{
This function will calculate the flight parameters by providing the camera settings
target flight height or gsd, front and side overlap.
}
\examples{
params = flight.parameters(
  gsd = 4,
  side.overlap = 0.8,
  front.overlap = 0.8,
  flight.speed.kmh = 54,
  max.gsd = 0
)
