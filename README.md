An R package for generating UAV flight plans, specially for Litchi.

## Installation

This package should be installed using the devtools.

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("caiohamamura/flightplanning-R")
```

## This fork

* adopts the package to R >= 4.2.0 (backward compatible) - DONE
* added `grid = FALSE | TRUE` parameter, which sets the flying direction over polygon - DONE
<<<<<<< HEAD
* added input for `sf` polygons -- `roi` can be read with `sf::st_read()` - DONE
* try to replace {rgdal}, {rgeos} and {sp} with {sf} - WIP
=======
* added input for `sf` polygons -- `roi` can be read with `sf::st_read()`

## Usage
There are two main functions available:
 * `flight.parameters()`: this will calculate the flight parameters given desired settings for GSD/height, target overlap, flight speed and camera specifications.
 * `litchi.plan()`: it depends on the `flight.parameters()` return object to generate the CSV flight plan ready to import into the Litchi Hub.
 
### flight.parameters
 - `height`: target flight height, default NA
 - `gsd`: target ground resolution in centimeters, must provide either `gsd` or `height`
 - `focal.length35`: numeric. Camera focal length 35mm equivalent, default 20
 - `image.width.px`: numeric. Image width in pixels, default 4000
 - `image.height.px`: numeric. Image height in pixels, default 3000
 - `side.overlap`: desired width overlap between photos, default 0.8
 - `front.overlap`: desired height overlap between photos, default 0.8
 - `flight.speed.kmh`: flight speed in km/h, default 54.
 
 ### litchi.plan
  - `roi`: range of interest loaded as an OGR layer, must be in
a metric units projection for working properly
 - `output`: output path for the csv file
 - `flight.params`: Flight Parameters. parameters calculated from flight.parameters()
 - `gimbal.pitch.angle`: gimbal angle for taking photos, default -90 (overriden at flight time)
 - `flight.lines.angle`: angle for the flight lines, default -1 (auto set based on larger direction)
 - `max.waypoints.distance`: maximum distance between waypoints in meters,
default 2000 (some issues have been reported with distances > 2 Km)
 - `max.flight.time`: maximum flight time. If mission is greater than the estimated time, 
 it will be splitted into smaller missions.
 - `starting.point`: numeric (1, 2, 3 or 4). Change position from which to start the flight, default 1
 - `grid`: boolean (FALSE | TRUE). Change the fly direction over polygon from parallel to perpendicular
